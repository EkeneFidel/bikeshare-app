Udacity Bikeshare captsone project with streamlit

In this project, I used streamlite a framework used to build web apps.

Link to the live app [Bikeshare Udacity App](https://bikeshare-udacity-app.herokuapp.com/).

### To navigate the app follow the following steps:
1. Fill in the parameters you want to use to filter the data **(City parameter is compulsory only)** on the sidebar on the left.


2. After each parameter is typed, press enter to generate the data.


3. Once the data is generated, you can adjust the slider on the sidebar on the left to view the raw data.
